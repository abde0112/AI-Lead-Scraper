I need you to modify the "Send to Webhook" functionality in this Phoenix Leads application to fix CORS errors when sending data to Zapier.

Current issue: The app is trying to send data directly to the Zapier webhook URL, which causes a "Failed to fetch" error due to CORS restrictions.

Solution needed: Use a CORS proxy to bypass the restriction.

Please make these changes:

1. Update the webhook send function to use a CORS proxy URL
2. Use this CORS proxy: https://corsproxy.io/?
3. Prepend the CORS proxy URL to the Zapier webhook URL when making the fetch request
4. The format should be: https://corsproxy.io/?{zapierWebhookURL}

Example:
- Original URL: https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/abcdef
- With proxy: https://corsproxy.io/?https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/abcdef

5. Keep all other functionality the same (JSON payload structure, error handling, success messages)
6. Make sure the webhook URL from the input field is properly encoded when added to the proxy URL

Please update the code accordingly.
